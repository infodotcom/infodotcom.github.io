            <h1>how to create a website </h1>
            <br>
            <br>Most customers will expect to be able to find your business on the internet.<br>
             Whether you are selling your products online, or simply want to provide some information about your business and your contact details,<br>
              having a website is almost essential.

            It's a good idea to think about what you hope to achieve with your website before you start creating one.<br>
             Researching your competitors' websites can help you get a clear idea of what may work best for you.
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>To create a website, you need to follow 4 basic steps.
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>1. Register your domain name
             <br>
             <br>Your domain name should reflect your products or services so that your customers can
             <br>easily find your business through a search engine. Your customers may also expect your
             <br>domain name to be similar to your business name.
             <br>Your domain name will also be used for your email address. While you can use a free email address such as hotmail,<br> sending emails from a business address looks more professional.
             <br>
             <br>2. Find a web hosting company
             <br>
             <br>3. Prepare your content
             <br>
             <br>4. Build your website
             You can build your own website or have a professional web developer build it for you. Websites need to be kept up to date, so make sure you plan for ongoing maintenance.
             
             You can use a website publishing package to build your own website. These are similar to word processors, but also have inbuilt features to convert your text and images to web content and send it to your website.
             
             Having someone else build a website for you is a good idea if you're new to online business. A professional web developer can build your site quickly and provide guidance on successful web design. Hiring a professional can be particularly useful if you are looking at having an online shop or offering other services through your website.
             
             You will need to design your website so it can be easily used on smartphones and other mobile devices. Optimising your website for mobile use means that the growing number of people using phones and tablets to access the internet can use your site while they are out and about.<br>
